            <p>I want to thank <em>Samantha's Supper</em> for suppling this recipe.</p>
            <p>Some opening remarks on Mum's Cottage Pie; the recipe is quite versatile. After having made this recipe a few times, try swapping out meats, types of chees and the body type of the potatoes. You may even want to try sweet potatoes and seasoning and adjust the side dishes accordingly. Regarding the original receipe ingredients, some good sides include those with a touch of sweetness: honey carrots and/or sweet corn.</p>

            <h3>Steps to making Mum's delicious Pie</h3>
                <ol>
                    <il><em>Step 1</em></il>
                    <p>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and mash with milk and butter. Season with salt and pepper.
                    </p>
                    <il><em>Step 2</em></il>
                    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
                    <il><em>Step 3</em></il>
                    <p>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; saute until translucent. Add ground beef; cook, breaking up lumps with a wooden spoon, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add sherry; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low.</p>
                    <il><em>Step 4</em></il>
                    <p>Season the beef mixture with salt and pepper, and stir in Worcestershire sauce. Sprinkle in flour and mix well until mixture is thick and clings together, 1 to 2 minutes more.
                    </p>
                    <il><em>Step 5</em></il>
                    <p>Pour beef mixture into the bottom of a casserole dish. Spread mashed potatoes evenly across the top. Season with salt and pepper. Scatter 1/2 cup plus 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese on top. Press a fork into the edges of the casserole to make a pattern.
                    </p>
                    <il><em>Step 6</em></il>
                    <p>Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until piping hot and cheese is melted down, about 30 minutes.
                    </p>
                </ol>

                <h3>Cook's Notes</h3>
                <p>Recipe can easily be doubled to feed a family of four</p>
                <p>use your choice of greated cheese.</p>
                <p>Tastes best made the day before if possible. If freezing, make as above and chill in the fridge. Cover with a layer of aluminum foil and a layer of plastic wrap (ensure your casserole dish or tin is freezable). Defrost completely before reheating. I tend to cook when it has been frozen and defrosted with the foil still on (remove plastic wrap) for 20 minutes and the remaining 10 minutes uncovered.</p>
